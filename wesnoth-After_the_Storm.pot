"Greetings, translators! If you are reading this, you should be warned that\n"
"translating this campaign will most certainly not be an easy task. A few things\n"
"to keep in mind:\n"
"\n"
" * The 1.12 and 1.13/1.14 versions of the campaign are identical, using\n"
"   conditional code to keep compatibility for both versions. You should\n"
"   translate only ONE version of the campaign and then ask the WesCamp admin(s)\n"
"   to copy the strings over to the other version.\n"
"\n"
" * Especially later on, there are many non-visual cues indicating the mood of a\n"
"   scene or a line as spoken by a character. While reading the WML or playing\n"
"   the campaign helps, there are also many gettext comments scattered through\n"
"   to help with this. If you are using poedit or similar, you should be able\n"
"   to see the comments or annotations attached to a particular line (msgid),\n"
"   as well as the source file path(s) and line number(s).\n"
"\n"
" * Many lines are deliberately vaguely worded in the English original. You may\n"
"   find relevant comments or annotations, or you may ask in the campaign topic\n"
"   in the Wesnoth forums for help.\n"
"\n"
" * Only COMPLETE translations will be included with the campaign. You should\n"
"   notify the maintainer in the campaign’s topic once your translation is\n"
"   listed as such in http://gettext.wesnoth.org/.\n"
"\n"
"Have fun!"

#. The implication is not only that Elynia is hearing words she
#. herself uttered once (near the end of IftU), but also that
#. she is hearing them in her voice, possibly as a result of a
#. head trauma-induced hallucination.
#. See the previous implication. This is why the line is "who
#. are you?" and not "who is there?".
#. This line corresponds to Elynia's thoughts.

"The Energy Heart of a guardian is a separate organ which goes through its own separate growth and maturation process independent from the guardian’s body. Evidence indicates the number of Energy Hearts a guardian may have varies, possibly in relation with their corresponding aspect. It is known that the first incarnation of Uria had four such interconnected organs, whereas the first incarnation of Valdir had only two. Most other guardians during the First Cycle had only one.\n"

"Norsulan studies recently conducted on the late Guardian of Fire of the Second Cycle indicate that she only had one Energy Heart. Earlier studies conducted on her seed showed that it is possible to artificially grow the organ in non-Guardians, albeit with disastrous effects. An alternative approach was used to build the first prototype of an artificial Guardian, keeping the Energy Heart in a separate insulated container with a direct pathway to the host’s nervous system, and an electronic control unit."

"The Shaxthals kept most of the technology of the Argazars, losing magic and the advanced forms of biologic manipulation with which they had been created. Reduced to barely a few dozen, the Argazars figured out a biological weakness of their creations, a way to destroy most of the Shaxthals en masse. All but a few of the strongest creatures perished. Fatefully, the Argazars decided to keep them in cryogenic pods instead of destroying them forever, as they thought there might be a last hope of using reprogrammed shaxthals to rebuild their civilization at some point in the future.\n"

"That foolish thought condemned the Great Continent to an armageddon many eons later.\n"

"Long after the Fall of Wesnoth, the self-proclaimed Emperor of Chaos figured out a way to resurrect the creatures, and reproduce their technology by artificial means. The lorekeepers of the Empire even enabled them to them able to rapidly reproduce by their own means. Thus modified, they became the principal and most dreaded weapon of the Chaos Empire. After the defeat of the Emperor, the Shaxthals were freed from their imprisonment in the dark hives of the Heart, and adapted to the time-renewed ecology of the surface world. They then began to prey on the speaking peoples of Irdya."
